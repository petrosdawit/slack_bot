updates:

-> August 3 2016: updated the donate command so that the bot can parse through the text and check for the first number as a dollar amount and a non-profit that is registered. For now, there are only 5 that I put it that the bot will recognize. These can be changed by adding more into or deleting from the self._test_non_profits array.
