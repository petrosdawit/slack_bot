updates:

-> August 3 2016: updated the donate command so that the bot can parse through the text and check for the first number as a dollar amount and a non-profit that is registered. For now, there are only 5 that I put it that the bot will recognize. These can be changed by adding more into or deleting from the self._test_non_profits array.

-> August 4 2016: bot updates and searches for new users every 25 seconds. so while it runs, a new user can join the team and be updated to talk with the bot in that 25 seconds window

-> August 4 2016: in a team channel, bot refers to you as @username to avoid confusion
