For the future, but don't know when:

-> a dictionary that records activity of the user while the bot is running. turns the user's activity boolean to False when the user hasn't talked to the bot in the past x minutes. 

-> @ a user in a channel (not dm channel) when talking to a user when another user's activity is True
